This is an example of a HTK conversion script that converts HTK models
to Kaldi format models.  It's not being actively maintained.  This
script is not very general-- since HTK's MMF format can contain almost
anything, it's hard to create a general solution.

# HTK conversion script:
./convert_htk.sh ../.. /mnt/matylda5/jhu09/setup/CH1/English/exp/xwrd.R0_800_TB500/hmm84/MMF /mnt/matylda5/jhu09/setup/CH1/English/exp/xwrd.R0_800_TB500/hmm10_800_500/cluster.trees convert_dir

# can add optional args --no-cleanup and --linear-topology
