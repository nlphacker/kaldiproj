# This decoding script does not decode from scratch, but limits the
# decoding to a set of lattices from another directory-- these lattices
# do not have to be built with the same tree, but of course the integer
# word id's do have to match, i.e. you have to use the same vocabulary.
# (in the WSJ setup this is not a problem as we have the same vocab
# throughout).
#
# If the tree was the same, you wouldn't need to use this mechanism,
# you could use gmm-rescore-lattice.
#
# The way this script works is to create a separate decoding graph for
# each file, limited to just the word-sequences present in the original
# lattice.  This is done by making an unweighted word acceptor from
# the lattice, composing with the grammar (G), determinizing, and using
# this as the utterance-specific grammar which is given to 
# compile-train-graphs-fsts.  Note: in this case we put the transition
# weights into the FSTs during compilation, which is different from during
# GMM alignment in training, where they are added by the decoding program
#
# This script assumes you have a GMM model and the baseline
# [e.g. MFCC] features plus cepstral mean subtraction plus
# LDA+MLLT or similar transform.
# Its output is lattices, for a single broken-up piece of the data.
