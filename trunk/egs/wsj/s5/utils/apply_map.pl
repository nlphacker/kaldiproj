# This program is a bit like ./sym2int.pl in that it applies a map
# to things in a file, but it's a bit more general in that it doesn't
# assume the things being mapped to are single tokens, they could
# be sequences of tokens.  

# This program takes two arguments, which may be files or "-" for the
# standard input.  Both files must have lines with one or more fields,
# interpreted as a map from the first field (a string) to a list of strings.
# if the first file has as one of its lines
# A x y
# and the second has the lines
# x P
# y Q R
# then the output of this program will be
# A P Q R
# 
# Note that if x or y did not appear as the first field of file b, we would
# print a warning and omit the whole line rather than map it to the empty
# string.
