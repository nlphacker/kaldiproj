# This script does the decoding of a single batch of test data (on one core).
# It requires arguments.  It takes the graphdir and decoding directory,
# and the job number which can actually be any string (even ""); it expects
# a file $decode_dir/test${job_number}.scp to exist, and puts its output in
# $decode_dir/${job_number}.tra
