# usage: scripts/decode.sh [--per-spk] [--qsub-opts opts] [--no-queue] [--num-jobs n] <decode_dir> <graph> <decode_script> <test-scp> 

# Decode the testing data.   By default, uses "qsub"; if you don't have this on
# your system, you may want to use options "--no-queue --num-jobs 4" e.g. if you have a 4 core
# machine.
# Note: this script calls another script whose name you must specify on the command line,
# which does the actual decoding.  This script is mainly responsible for parallelization
# and job control.
#
# "decode_dir" is a directory to decode in.
# "graph" is somedir/HCLG.fst, a graph to decode with.
# "decode_script" is a script such as steps/decode_tri1.sh that can
#  decode an individual batch of data.
# "test_scp" is e.g. data/test_nov93.scp.
# "test_spk2utt" is e.g. data/test_nov93.spk2utt

# If you include as the last argument the "spk2utt" file, it will assume
# you are doing some speaker adaptation and require the data to be broken up
# by speaker; it will put the split-ut spk2utt and utt2spk files in the
# decoding directory (e.g. test1.spk2utt and test1.utt2spk).
# option will ensure that the splitting-up is done on a per-speaker basis and
# will put files like test1.spk2utt and test1.utt2spk in the decode_dir directory.
# The decoding scripts will detect the presence of these files and do their
# adaptation on a per-speaker basis.
