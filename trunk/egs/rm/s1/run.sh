exit 1 # Don't run this... it's to be run line by line from the shell.

# This script file cannot be run as-is; some paths in it need to be changed
# before you can run it.
# Search for /path/to.
# It is recommended that you do not invoke this file from the shell, but
# run the paths one by one, by hand.

# the step in data_prep/ will need to be modified for your system.

# First step is to do data preparation:
# This just creates some text files, it is fast.
# If not on the BUT system, you would have to change run.sh to reflect
# your own paths.
#

#Example arguments to run.sh: /mnt/matylda2/data/RM, /ais/gobi2/speech/RM, /cygdrive/e/data/RM
# RM is a directory with subdirectories rm1_audio1, rm1_audio2, rm2_audio
cd data_prep
#*** You have to change the pathname below.***
./run.sh /path/to/RM

# If it doesn't exist, the scripts below will make the directory "exp".

# mfcc should be set to some place to put training mfcc's
# where you have space.  Make sure you create the directory.
#e.g.: mfccdir=/mnt/matylda6/jhu09/qpovey/kaldi_rm_mfccb
# Note: mfccdir should be an absolute pathname

# To train and test SGMM systems:



# note: if the SGMM decoding is too slow, aside from playing
# with decoder beams and max-leaves, you can set e.g.
# --full-gmm-nbest=5 to the sgmm-gselect program (default is 15, 
# so max possible speedup with this setting is 3x).  For best WER,
# this should have the
# same value in training and test ("matched training"), but
# you can get the speed improvements by just doing it in test.
# You can take this all the way down to 1 for fastest speed, although
# this will degrade results.
