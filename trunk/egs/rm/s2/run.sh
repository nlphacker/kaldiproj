#exit 1 # Don't run this... it's to be run line by line from the shell.

# This script file cannot be run as-is; some paths in it need to be changed
# before you can run it.
# Search for /path/to.
# It is recommended that you do not invoke this file from the shell, but
# run the paths one by one, by hand.

# the step in data_prep/ will need to be modified for your system.

# First step is to do data preparation:
# This just creates some text files, it is fast.
# If not on the BUT system, you would have to change run.sh to reflect
# your own paths.
#

#Example arguments to run.sh: /mnt/matylda2/data/RM, /ais/gobi2/speech/RM, /cygdrive/e/data/RM
# RM is a directory with subdirectories rm1_audio1, rm1_audio2, rm2_audio
cd data_prep
#*** You have to change the pathname below.***
./run.sh /path/to/RM
cd ..

mkdir -p data
( cd data; cp ../data_prep/{train,test*}.{spk2utt,utt2spk} . ; cp ../data_prep/spk2gender.map . )

# This next step converts the lexicon, grammar, etc., into FST format.

# Next, make sure that "exp/" is someplace you can write a significant amount of
# data to (e.g. make it a link to a file on some reasonably large file system).
# If it doesn't exist, the scripts below will make the directory "exp".

# mfcc should be set to some place to put training mfcc's
# where you have space.
#e.g.: mfccdir=/mnt/matylda6/jhu09/qpovey/kaldi_rm_mfccb
mfccdir=/path/to/mfccdir
steps/make_mfcc_train.sh $mfccdir
steps/make_mfcc_test.sh $mfccdir



# first, we will train monophone GMM system to get training labels
steps/train_mono.sh
steps/decode_mono.sh  &



# Now we train the MLP,
# it will have CMVN normalized MFCCs as input and phoneme-state posteriors as output
steps/train_nnet.sh
#steps/decode_nnet.sh #TODO
