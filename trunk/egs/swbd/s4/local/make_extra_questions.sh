# This is specialized for this particular WSJ setup.
# It creates the extra questions that specialize within each phone to ask
# about the stress markers and positions.  We create one question for each stress-marker
# type and each position.
# We also have a question that asks about silences... just because
# our recipe may remove silence from the standard questions.


#  The standard input of this script should be a phones.txt frile.
