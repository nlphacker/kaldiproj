# This script makes lists of phones that are shared for building the monophone
# system and shared during phone clustering when creating questions for the
# triphone system.  It puts out a line for each "real" phone, and that line
# contains all the versions of the "real" phones.  With --nosil we have no
# silences in these sets; otherwise we share the silence phones SIL SPN and NSN
# into one group.

# Takes as standard input e.g. data/lang/phones.txt
