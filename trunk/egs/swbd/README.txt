About the Switchboard corpus

    This is conversational telephone speech collected as 2-channel, 8kHz-sampled
    data.  We are using just the Switchboard-1 Phase 1 training data.
    The catalog number LDC97S62 (Switchboard-1 Release 2) corresponds, we believe,
    to what we have.  We also use the Mississippi State transcriptions, which
    we download separately from
    http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/releases/switchboard_word_alignments.tar.gz


Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.

  s3: 
   Adding first version of scripts.  Only the earliest stages of
   this are finished.
   Note: this is closest to the s3/ scripts for WSJ.

  s4:
   This is currently unfinished; I had to commit it due to
   certain SVN limitations.  Changing the topology of the
   silence phones after finding a problem with the
   transition-probs.
