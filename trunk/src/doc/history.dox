/**
 \page history History of the Kaldi project

 Kaldi began its existence in the 2009 Johns Hopkins University workshop cumbersomely
 titled "Low Development Cost, High Quality Speech Recognition for New Languages and
 Domains" (see \ref history_ack).  The focus of that project was 
 Subspace Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM) based
 modeling and some investigations into lexicon learning.  The software which is now
 Kaldi began to be developed there, but the recipe we developed at that time was
 still dependent on HTK.  A list of participants in that workshop, official and 
 unofficial, is (alphabetically by last name):

 Pinar Akyazi, Mohit Agarwal, Lukas Burget, Arnab Ghoshal, Ondrej Glembek, Nagendra Goel,
 Martin Karafiat, Feng Kai, Daniel Povey, Ariya Rastrow, Richard C. Rose, Petr Schwarz,
 Samuel Thomas.

 Some of the participants of that workshop agreed to meet again in the summer of
 2010 in Brno, Czech Republic (hosted by the Brno University of Technology).  The
 aim of that workshop was to create a recipe based on the work done in 2009 that
 was clean and releasable, and to create a general-purpose speech toolkit as a
 byproduct.  The problem we were trying to solve was that our previous recipe was
 based on disparate scripts involving both HTK and our own early "Kaldi" code,
 and was not easy to encapsulate.  We also felt that a well-engineered, modern,
 general-purpose speech toolkit with an open license would be an asset to the
 speech-recognition community.  During August of 2010 the following group of
 people met in Brno to work on this (again alphabetically):

 Pinar Akyazi, Lukas Burget, Gilles Boullianne, Ondrej Glembek, Arnab Ghoshal,
 Nagendra Goel, Mirko Hannemann, Petr Motlicek, Daniel Povey, Yanmin Qian, Petr
 Schwarz, Jan Silowsky, Georg Stemmer, and Karel Vesely.

 We also had some remote help around this time and shortly afterward, from
 Sandeep Boda, Sandeep Reddy and Haihua Xu (who helped with coding, code cleanup
 and documentation); we were visited by Michael Riley (who helped us to understand
 OpenFst and gave some lectures on FSTs), and would like to acknowledge the help of
 Honza Cernocky (for allowing us to have the workshop and helping to organize it),
 Renata Kohlova (administration), and Tomas Kasparek (system administration).  
 It is possible that this list of contributors contains
 oversights; any important omissions are unlikey to be intentional.

 A lot of code was written during the summer of 2010 but we still did not have a
 complete working system.  Some of the participants of the 2010 workshop
 continued working to complete the toolkit and get a working set of training scripts.  
 The code was released on May 14th, 2011.
