 \page tutorial_svn Kaldi Tutorial: Version control with Subversion (5 minutes)

 In case you are unfamiliar with the Subversion (svn) version control system, we
 give a brief overview of some commands that might be useful to you.  Subversion commands
 always look like: "svn [command] [arguments]"; you can do "svn help" to see what
 commands are available, or "svn help <command>" for help on a specific command.  
  In kaldi-1 or any subdirectory, type
 \verbatim
   svn up
 \endverbatim
 (this is short for "svn update").  If we have committed changes to the repository
 in the several minutes since you installed Kaldi, you should see output like
 the following:
\verbatim
kaldi-1: svn update
U    src/lat/Makefile
U    src/nnetbin/nnet-forward.cc
Updated to revision 191.
\endverbatim
 More likely, it will just say something like "At revision 191."  
 To see if you have made any changes to anything, type 
\verbatim
 svn status
\endverbatim
 This will
 list files that you changed or that have been added.  Files that have been added
 to the directories but are not under version control because you have not used the
 "svn add" command, will appear with the descriptor '?' (you will see all the
 binaries that were compiled).  Next, edit a version-controlled file (for example,
 src/Makefile; add a comment or something), and type
\verbatim
 svn diff
\endverbatim
This should show how your version differs from the copy that you downlaoded.
If you are going to be 
 contributing to the Kaldi project (and we do welcome new contributors), 
 then you should become familiar with other commands such
 as "svn add", "svn commit" and so on.  For this, there are tutorials available
 online.
