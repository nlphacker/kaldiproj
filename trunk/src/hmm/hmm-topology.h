 // The following would be the text form for the "normal" HMM topology.
 // Note that the first state is the start state, and the final state,
 // which must have no output transitions and must be nonemitting, has
 // an exit probability of one (no other state can have nonzero exit
 // probability; you can treat the transition probability to the final
 // state as an exit probability).
 // Note also that it's valid to omit the "<PdfClass>" entry of the <State>, which
 // will mean we won't have a pdf on that state [non-emitting state].  This is equivalent
 // to setting the <PdfClass> to -1.  We do this normally just for the final state.
 // The Topology object can have multiple <TopologyEntry> blocks.
 // This is useful if there are multiple types of topology in the system.

 <Topology>
 <TopologyEntry>
 <ForPhones> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 </ForPhones>

// kNoPdf is used where pdf_class or pdf would be used, to indicate,
// none is there.  Mainly useful in skippable models, but also used
// for end states.
// A caveat with nonemitting states is that their out-transitions
// are not trainable, due to technical issues with the way
// we decided to accumulate the stats.  Any transitions arising from (*)
// HMM states with "kNoPdf" as the label are second-class transitions,
// They do not have "transition-states" or "transition-ids" associated
// with them.  They are used to create the FST version of the
// HMMs, where they lead to epsilon arcs.
// (*) "arising from" is a bit of a technical term here, due to the way
// (if reorder == true), we put the transition-id associated with the
// outward arcs of the state, on the input transition to the state.
