 Help needed:
  - Proofread documentation and make suggestions for 
    changes/clarification.
  - Try to run the scripts and compile on various platforms, and
    report problems.

=====
dan's TODO:
 check out Stefan's code for nnet rescoring.  finish biglm stuff.
minor:
 add void Check(); function to most config classes.
 make it possible to sum tree accs.
 normalize binaries so they never take summed accs (unless sum-accs program)
 remove mix-up, mix-down options from gmm-est (have separate program)
 make questions on disk be in text form (use sym2int.pl etc.)... same
   for transcripts while decoding.
 maybe move UBM clustering somewhere else [from am-diag-gmm]?
 document the --cmd options in wsj/s3 scripts
 change sgmm code so gselect is no longer optional [only in discrim/?]
 remove KALDI_EXIT and modify KALDI_ERR macro to behave like it.
 Make sure scripts don't depend on . being on PATH
 Make ApplySoftMax() function more efficient (does two exp()'s per element)
 possibly change the way lattice-compose works to remove properties hack.

gmm-latgen-faster [Not started].  Need to write internal code for this (Mirko, but possibly wait a bit till I finalize lattice-simple-decoder.).  As gmm-latgen-simple but not using std::unordered_map for current + previous frame's tokens-- would use the HashList stuff.

lattice-rand-path [not started]  Eventually have a version that computes a random path weighted by probability?  Not sure how useful.

lattice-combine [not started]  This would take two archives of lattices with identical topologies and possibly different scores, and combine the scores in some, probably linear, way.  It's a cheap way to emulate having more than 2 weights on the lattice.  Let's not create this until we have a use for it though.

lex-rescore-lattice [not started].  This would add in the probabilities from the lexicon to the graph part of the lattice score.  This is a tricky algorithm that involves working out the corresponding phone-sequences for paths through the lattices, and simultaneously matching the labels on both sides of the (lattice and lexicon) FSTs.  I'll work on this at some point.

transition-rescore-lattice: add transition-probs to a lattice. [possible..]

lattice-nbest [not started] From a lattice, create N-best lists.  (I think the ShortestPath algorithm does what we need).  There are different possible outputs to this program, e.g.: word-Nbest (using Int32VectorVectorWriter), transition-id-Nbest (using the same), acoustic scores (BaseFloatVectorWriter), LM scores, acoustic+lm scores?  I'm not sure whether the same program should do all this.  Note: the ShortestPath algorithm creates an FST representing the N-best list, and we could consider writing this FST form too.  Perhaps we should wait till we see what the output is needed for.

=============
COMPLETED, MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FEATURES

gmm-latgen-simple   [finished]  Create lattices.  Write either state-level traceback or word-level lattice-determinized output, depending on options.

lattice-lmrescore [not started] Given an FST representing an LM, and a scale with which to add the LM score (typically 1 or -1): composes it (on the right) with the lattice (in Lattice format), and then lattice-determinizes it to make there be only one path per word-seq.  Note: if the LM scale (to add) is negative, we would have to negate the weights before lattice-determinizing, and then negate again after.

lm-rescore-lattice-{fst,arpa} [for Gilles; not started]  Replace (or add) graph scores on a lattice with newly computed LM scores.  Normal usage: lm-rescore-lattice <LM FST/arpa> <lattice-in-archive> <lattice-out-archive>.
  Options would include --lm-scale [default = 1]; set to -1 for removing old LM scores; and --old-graph-scale [default = 0] to keep the old graph scores with some scale [e.g. useful if we previously added transition probabilities].

lattice-to-post [not started]  Does forward-backward on the lattice, using its current weights, and converts it to state-level (transition-id-level) posteriors.   Would include --acoustic-scale option for convenience.
   Normal usage: lattice-to-post --acoustic-scale=$acwt <in-archive> <out-archive>.  Another option would be --rand-prune, which would do randomized pruning of state-level posteriors if they are below a threshold, as I already do in some programs that create Gaussian-level posteriors. [the randomization is there to preserve expectations].

lattice-scale [not started] Applies scaling to lattices' scores [ScaleLattice function].... would probably be called normally as lattice-scale --acoustic-scale=0.1 <in-archive> <out-archive>, but
also with options --graph-scale, --acoustic2graph-scale, --graph2acoustic-scale, corresponding to a 2x2 scaling matrix.

gmm-rescore-lattice [not started]  Replace acoustic scores on a lattice with newly computed acoustic scores.  Normal usage: gmm-rescore-lattice model <lattice-in-archive> <feats-in-archive> <lattice-out-archive>.  
  Would have option --old-acoustic-scale [default = 0] to keep the old acoustics with some scale.
  Might add options to add in the transition probabilities to either the acoustic part or the graph part of the weights-- or might create a separate program for this.



=============
OLDER TODOS
=====

 TODO items (Arnab):
  Check the clapack configuration in the configure script... not clear
     what the purpose of CLAPACK_ROOT is.  I think the configure script
     should create a Makefile that doesn't depend on external variables (Dan)
  Add separate min-count at root of tree for regression-tree fMLLR/MLLR
  Add fMLLR scripts for SGMM.
  Add documentation for regression-tree fMLLR (etc.) and possibly expand
   documentation for acoustic modeling code.

 TODO items (Dan):
  Harmonize output style of decoders (e.g. same type of lattices).
  Check kaldi-decoder and add example scripts.
  Look into how better to estimate vectors in training time
    (I think WERs degraded when I fixed a script bug that
    was having the effect of re-estimating spk-vecs from
    zero each time).
  Remove non-Kaldi code from decoder/
  Rename to branches/kaldi-1.0

  Add code to average over multiple models while aligning ...

 documentation:
  add something on dir structure
  add something on doxygen

  -restore table_examples to mainpage.dox when done.
  -Include some examples of advanced usage of tables.

  [? + make sub-directories for different language-models/lexicons in scripts]

   - See if I can still do the reversed decoding if possible, and
     maybe rationalize the graph creation.

   - Implement lattice generation 

--
Minor:

 RE reversing FSTs:  need to reverse Arpa.  
   programs to: convert Arpa->exclusive counts;
   exclusive counts-> inclusive counts; reverse inclusive counts;
   inclusive counts-> exclusive counts; exclusive counts->Arpa.


in future (maybe)
 make sure calls like fopen, strtoll, strtod (check for more) use reentrancy 
 structures.  (also rand_r, snprintf vs spritnf...?) (?)

 Make sure, when we get the SGMM stuff working, that results are fully
  reproducible (last year's code does not
  seem to have been reproducible, due I imagine to rand() issues.) 
 
 Add the stuff RE symmetric SGMMS, from the old to the new  SGMM code. [?]
