This directory contains some of the source for the Doxygen documentation (the
code itself, and its comments, is the rest of the source).  Doxygen will create
the actual documentation in ../html/ (e.g. open ../html/index.html in a browser).
To run doxygen, type "doxygen" from one directory above this.  If this does
not work, search for "Kaldi main page" online and you will hopefully get a 
version of the documentation.
