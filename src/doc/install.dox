 \page install Downloading and installing Kaldi

 \section install_download  Dowloading Kaldi

  You first need to install Subversion (SVN).  The most current version of Kaldi can
   be downloaded by typing into a shell:
  \verbatim
    svn co https://kaldi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kaldi/trunk kaldi-trunk
  \endverbatim
  A branch corresponding to version 1 of Kaldi may be obtained at:
  \verbatim
    svn co https://kaldi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kaldi/branches/1 kaldi-1
  \endverbatim
  This may be more stable than the ``trunk'' version, which may occassionally
  be broken by new changes.
  If you want to get updates and bug fixes you can go to some checked-out
 directory, and type
  \verbatim
    svn update
  \endverbatim
 If "svn update" prints out scary looking messages about conflicts (caused by
 you changing parts of files that were later modified centrally),
 you may have to resolve the conflicts; for that, we recommend that you
 read about how svn works.

  \section install_install Installing Kaldi
   
  The top-level installation instructions are in the file INSTALL. 
  For Windows, there are separate instructions in windows/INSTALL.
  See also \ref build_setup which explains how the build process
  works internally.

  The example scripts are in egs/
