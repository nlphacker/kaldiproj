Example of debug command with valgrind:
in matrix/
 valgrind  ./matrix-lib-test

# or if there are errors the following options may be useful:
 valgrind  --leak-check=full --db-attach=yes ./matrix-lib-test

The easiest way to run valgrind, however, is "make valgrind" which automatically
runs all the tests.  It will fail if valgrind is not happy.  Then you should
manually run valgrind on whichever one failed (which you can figure out by
looking at valgrind.out in the last directory, and looking for the last
filename *-test that was printed).



----
notes on potential install problems:
if you get errors like:
.../matrix/kaldi-matrix.cc:43: undefined reference to `clapack_sgetrf'
then you may be linking with a version of the library liblapack.a that
does not have this type of symbol: on UToronto's machines that library did
not export that symbol but there was a newer one called liblapack-3.a that
did.

If you get errors about not being able to find files in various system directories,
try typing 'make depend'.
