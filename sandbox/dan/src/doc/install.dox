  \section install_warning Warning on recent Sourceforge update

   This is a warning to all those who originally downloaded Kaldi before March 20, 2013.
   The svn location where Kaldi's repository resides has changed.  In order to get the
  latest updates you need to update your repository.  Go to the root of the directory where
  you previously checked it out, and type:
 \verbatim
   svn switch --relocate  https://kaldi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kaldi svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/kaldi/code
 \endverbatim
  You can verify that it worked by typing "svn info".  You should see the new location.

 \section install_download  Dowloading Kaldi

  You first need to install Subversion (SVN).  The most current version of Kaldi,
  possibly including unfinished and experimental features, can
   be downloaded by typing into a shell:
  \verbatim
    svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/kaldi/code/trunk kaldi-trunk
  \endverbatim
  You can check out the "stable" branch of Kaldi, which is mostly a subset of the
  "trunk" with more stringent quality control, as follows (but note: right now, it is
  a few months behind the trunk):
  \verbatim
    svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/kaldi/code/stable kaldi-stable
  \endverbatim
   If you want to get updates and bug fixes you can go to some checked-out
 directory, and type
  \verbatim
    svn update
  \endverbatim
 If "svn update" prints out scary looking messages about conflicts (caused by
 you changing parts of files that were later modified centrally),
 you may have to resolve the conflicts; for that, we recommend that you
 read about how svn works.


  \section install_install Installing Kaldi
   
  The top-level installation instructions are in the file INSTALL. 
  For Windows, there are separate instructions in windows/INSTALL.
  See also \ref build_setup which explains how the build process
  works internally.

  The example scripts are in egs/
