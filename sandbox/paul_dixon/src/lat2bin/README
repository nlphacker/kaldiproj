Some utils for processing Kaldi lattices.

compactlattice44-arc.so lattice4-arc.so  Shared objects containing Kaldi
lattice types to allow the OpenFst shell commands to directly manipulate the lattices.

lattice-info. Displays OpenFst style info for each of the lattice in the
archive

lattice-filter. Applies a pipeline of commands to each of the lattices in the
archive. For example the below would convert lattice to word level acceptor and
extract the single best word sequence.

 lattice-filter "fstproject --project_output | fstrmepsilon | fstshortestpath" \
 ark:lat.1 ark:1best.1 


lattice-filter-text. Same as above but assumes the last command in the pipeline
outputs text (fstdraw, fstshortestdistance).


For the lattice-filter commands the shared objects need to be on the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or in the working directory and OpenFst is commands are on the
path.

The filtering commands make use of the libexecstream library.
