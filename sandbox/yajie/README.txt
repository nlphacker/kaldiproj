This is official Kaldi readme. You are now in Kaldi/trunk mirror.
Read Kaldi.md and INSTALL.md first!


See http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/ for documentation 
(may not always be fully up to date).  This documentation
is generated by running "doxygen" from the src/ directory,
and appears in src/html/

I assume that the reader would like to (1) build the toolkit
and (2) run the example system builds.

To build the toolkit: see ./INSTALL.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux; Darwin; and Cygwin (has not been
tested on more "exotic" varieties of UNIX).  For Windows installation
instructions (excluding Cygwin), see windows/INSTALL.

To run the example system builds, see egs/README.txt

If you encounter problems (and you probably will), please do not hesitate
to contact the developers at
 https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=kaldi-developers
In addition to specific questions, please let us know if there are specific
aspects of the project that you feel could be improved, that you find confusing,
etc., and which missing features you most wish it had.
