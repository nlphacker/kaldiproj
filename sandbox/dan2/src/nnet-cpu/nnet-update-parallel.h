/// DoBackpropParallelSafe is as DoBackpropParallel, but takes an extra

/// per-frame objective function is allowed to degrade per training example,(his
/// will be equal to a reasonable per-frame degradation, such as 1.0, divided
/// by the #samples in the training run, e.g. 200k).  
/// This needs a little explanation.  When we run parallel SGD runs on different
/// machines and then average the parameters at the end of each iteration, what
/// we typically find is that for each individual job the objective function
/// (whether measured on test data or validation data) is worse than at the start,
/// but after averaging it's better.  This is because of reduced parameter noise
/// after averaging.  However, if the individual jobs get *too much* worse
/// (e.g. the log-prob per frame is worse by more than about 1.0), we can't
/// always recover via averaging.  In this function we attempt to put a limit on
/// how much degradation we are willing to accept.  Rather than an absolute
/// limit we impose a limit per training sample so that, say, halfway through
/// training the amount of degradation we accept is half what we'd accept at the
/// end.  This will make the learning rates more consistent throughout the
/// training run.  This function basically applies the limit by controlling the
/// learning rates, but if at a certain point it decreases the learning rate of
/// a layer by a certain factor, it also scales the changes in parameters of
/// that layer by the same factor, as if it had "retroactively applied" the
/// learning rate change.
