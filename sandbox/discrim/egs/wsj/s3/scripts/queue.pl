# queue.pl has the same functionality as run.pl, except that
# it runs the job in question on the queue.  
# Suppose from the directory /cur/location, you run the command:
#  queue.pl somedir/some.log my-prog "--opt=foo bar" foo \|  other-prog baz
# and queue.pl will do something roughly equivalent to the following:
#
# cat >somedir/q/some.sh <<EOF
# #!/bin/bash
# cd /cur/location
# . path.sh
# ( my-prog '--opt=foo bar' foo |  other-prog baz ) >& some.log
# EOF
# qsub -sync y -j y -o /cur/location/some.log /cur/location/q/some.sh && exit 0;
# qsub -sync y -j y -o /cur/location/some.log /cur/location/q/some.sh 
#
# What this means is it creates a .sh file to put the command in,
# along with changing the directory and setting the path.  It then runs
# this command on the queue, and tries a second time if it fails the first
# time.
#
# Note: as a special case, if the log file is in a directory called log/,
# this program puts the q/ directory one level up.
#
# As a mechanism to pass options to qsub: this program will take
# any leading arguments beginning with "-", and the ones immediately 
# following them, and give them to qsub.  E.g. if you call
#  queue.pl -l ram_free=600M,mem_free=600M foo bar
# it will pass the first two arguments to qsub.
