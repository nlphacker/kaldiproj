Example of debug command with valgrind:
in matrix/
 valgrind  ./matrix-lib-test

# or if there are errors the following options may be useful:
 valgrind  --leak-check=full --db-attach=yes ./matrix-lib-test

The easiest way to run valgrind, however, is "make valgrind" which automatically
runs all the tests.  It will fail if valgrind is not happy.  Then you should
manually run valgrind on whichever one failed (which you can figure out by
looking at valgrind.out in the last directory, and looking for the last
filename *-test that was printed).

 For emacs users:
  ensure proper indentation it may be helpful to copy
     http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-c-style.el
  to your home directory as ".google-c-style.el", and add to your .emacs file the lines:
\verbatim
  (load-file "~/.google-c-style.el")
  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'google-set-c-style)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'google-make-newline-indent)
\endverbatim
