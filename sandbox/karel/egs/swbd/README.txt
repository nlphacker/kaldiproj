About the Switchboard corpus

    This is conversational telephone speech collected as 2-channel, 8kHz-sampled
    data.  We are using just the Switchboard-1 Phase 1 training data.
    The catalog number LDC97S62 (Switchboard-1 Release 2) corresponds, we believe,
    to what we have.  We also use the Mississippi State transcriptions, which
    we download separately from
    http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/releases/switchboard_word_alignments.tar.gz


Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.

  s3: 
   This Switchboard recipe is currently a work in progress, but the
   parts of it that are there should run, and we are trying to keep
   the RESULTS file up to date.
   Note: this is quite similar to the s3/ recipes for WSJ; the
   scripts that are invoked are the same, except for the data
   preparation.
