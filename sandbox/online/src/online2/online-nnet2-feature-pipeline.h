/// This file contains a different version of the feature-extraction pipeline in
/// \ref online-feature-pipeline.h, specialized for use in neural network
/// decoding with iVectors.  Our recipe is that we extract iVectors that will
/// be used as an additional input to the neural network, in addition to
/// a window of several frames of spliced raw features (MFCC, PLP or filterbanks).
/// The iVectors are extracted on top of a (splice+LDA+MLLT) feature pipeline,
/// with the added complication that the GMM posteriors used for the iVector
/// extraction are obtained with a version of the features that has online
/// cepstral mean (and optionally variance) normalization, whereas the stats for
/// iVector are accumulated with a non-mean-normalized version of the features.
/// The idea here is that we want the iVector to learn the mean offset, but
/// we want the posteriors to be somewhat invariant to mean offsets.
///
/// Most of the logic for the actual iVector estimation is in \ref
/// online-ivector-feature.h, this header contains mostly glue.


/// This configuration class is to set up OnlineNnet2FeaturePipelineInfo, which
/// in turn is the configuration class for OnlineNnet2FeaturePipeline.
/// Instead of taking the options for the parts of the feature pipeline
/// directly, it reads in the names of configuration classes.
