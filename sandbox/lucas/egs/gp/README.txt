About the GlobalPhone corpus:
    This is a corpus of read sentences from the newspapers in 19
    different languages recorded under varying degrees of "clean" 
    conditions. There is roughly 15-20 hours of training data for
    each language, as well as DEV and EVAL sets of roughly 2 hours 
    each.

Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.  
Note: s1 is the "default" set of scripts at the moment.

  s1: This setup is experiments with GMM-based systems with various 
      Maximum Likelihood 
      techniques including global and speaker-specific transforms.
      See a parallel setup in ../wsj/s3
