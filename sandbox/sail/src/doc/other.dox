/**
 \page other Other Kaldi-related resources

 The main places where Kaldi knowledge can be found are this website,
 and in the subversion repository (see \ref install for instructions on
 obtaining it.  The repository contains the Kaldi code, installation scripts,
 and example scripts for a number of different datasets, which are located
 in the sub-directory egs/).  

 This page contains  pointers to a few Kaldi-related resources that are located elsewhere.

 Kaldi's <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/> project page on Sourceforge </a> contains
 a number of useful resources.

 The <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/forums> Kaldi forums on Sourceforge </a> are
 a good place to ask questions.

  For the slides for a short series of Kaldi lectures that were delivered in 2012, 
  see <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/dpovey/kaldi-lectures> here </a>.
