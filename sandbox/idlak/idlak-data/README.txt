This directory contains data for the idlak front end and voice
building system. language specific data for English (en)
Within the directory their are accent specific directories i.e (ga) -
general american, and within there speaker specific directories (bdl).

In addition language regions may be present with directory names of
the form region_<2 letter ISO code> i.e. region_us 

The language directory name also follows the ISO language code. The
accent names are two letter and lower case and are kaldi specific. The
voice names are three letters and lower case and are kaldi specific.

During voice building this data is amalgamated with speaker specific
data to produce a speaker directory which includes automatically
generated data (such as HMM models).

The presence of the file idlak-data-flat in a data directory causes
all data to be read from that directory. This file should be present
in voice directories which contain all data for a specific synthesis
voice.

If not present the system will assume a full idlak-data framework and
search for the presence of the file idlak-data-trunk in . .. ../.. and
../../.. if found this establishes this is a full idlak-data
framework.

The data in these directories is not automatically generated by the
kaldi system (although much has been automatically generated by source
data such as the lexicon).

This means hand editing this data to improve the system
makes sense in kaldi terms.

In the future this may change (for example cart trees may be
constructed from within kaldi voice building making the cart trees in
these directories redundant).
