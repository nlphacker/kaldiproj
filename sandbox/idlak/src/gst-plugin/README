= Kaldi Gstreamer plugin =

Plugin for GStreamer 1.0 framework, using the OnlineGmmDecodeFaster 
decoder. Accepts 16000 kHz 16 bit audio and decodes it on the fly,
decoder words are "pushed" out using a callback.


== Requirements ==

  * GStreamer 1.0, including the 'good' plugins and the GStreamer tools package
  * Development packages for Gstreamer 1.0 (libgstreamer1.0-dev on Debian Jessie)

== Install ==

Compile rest of the Kaldi using the 'shared' flavour. To do this,
invoke 'configure' with the `--shared` switch.

Also, make the online extensions  (make ext)

Now, run:

make depend
make

This should result in libgstkaldi.so which contains the GStreamer plugin

== Usage ==

See egs/voxforge/gst_demo
