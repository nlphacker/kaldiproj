== Download ==

PDNN is publicly available from its Sourceforge repository. Download all the source codes by
svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/kaldipdnn/code-0/trunk/pdnn pdnn

== Requirements ==

PDNN is a lightweight deep learning toolkit developed under the Theano environment. There are two requirements for PDNN to work:
1. A GPU card should be available on your computing machine.
2. Theano should be installed properly.

== Commands ==

All the PDNN functionalities are called via the top level commands. Details on their arguments can be found on the website. The commands include:
run_DNN.py -- SGD fine-tuning of DNNs; including implementations of maxout and dropout
run_SDA.py -- pre-training of DNN layers using stacked denoising autoencoders (SdAs)
run_CNN.py -- convolutional neural networks
run_CnnFeat.py -- generate convolution outputs from convolution layers

== Directory Structure ==

io_func -- pfile reading functions; various network IO functions; network format conversion, i.e., from raw to Kaldi
layers  -- various layer types: convolution, fully-connected, denoising autoencoder, maxout, logistic regression
models  -- convolutional networks, deep networks, dropout networks, stacked denoising autoencoders
utils   -- various utility functions: learning rates, argument parsing, etc
