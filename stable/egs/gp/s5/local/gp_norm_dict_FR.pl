# This script normalizes the GlobalPhone French dictionary. It (optionally) 
# tags the phones with language ('FR') marker. It also converts the words to 
# UTF8 and lowercases everything, either of which can be diabled with command 
# line switches.
# *No special treatment for acronyms !!! Acronyms are not somehow marked, so maybe some acronyms are really hidden in dico.
