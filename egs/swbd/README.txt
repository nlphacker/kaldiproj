About the Switchboard corpus

    This is conversational telephone speech collected as 2-channel, 8kHz-sampled
    data.  We are using just the Switchboard-1 training data.
    Available from the LDC as catalog number LDC93S3A (it may be possible to
    get the same data using combinations of other catalog numbers, but this
    is the one we used).

Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.
