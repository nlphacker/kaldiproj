# Compute cepstral mean and variance statistics per speaker.  
# We do this in just one job; it's fast.
# This script takes no options.
#
# Note: there is no option to do CMVN per utterance.  The idea is
# that if you did it per utterance it would not make sense to do
# per-speaker fMLLR on top of that (since you'd be doing fMLLR on
# top of different offsets).  Therefore what would be the use
# of the speaker information?  In this case you should probably
# make the speaker-ids identical to the utterance-ids.  The
# speaker information does not have to correspond to actual
# speakers, it's just the level you want to adapt at.
