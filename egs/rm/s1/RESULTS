# notes on timing of training with ATLAS vs. MKL:
# all below are with -O0.
# tested time taken with "time steps/train_tri2a.sh"
#  [on svatava]: with "default" compile (which is 32-bit+ATLAS)
#   real    14m19.458s
#   user    15m38.695s
# 64-bit+ATLAS:
#
# 64-bit+MKL:
# real    12m45.664s
# user    13m53.770s
# + removed -O0 -DKALDI_PARANOID:
# [made almost no difference to training]:
# real    12m31.829s
# user    13m48.967s
# sys 0m28.146s

# 64-bit but ATLAS instead of MKL
# [and with default options, which includes: -O0 -DKALI_PARANOID].
#real    10m50.088s
#user    12m6.914s
#sys 0m17.419s
# Did this again:
#real    10m17.891s
#user    11m28.695s
#sys     0m14.087s

# But when I tested "fmllr-diag-gmm-test", all after removing
# the options -O0 -DKALDI_PARANOID, the ordering of timing was
# different:
# 64-bit+ATLAS was 0.361s
# 64-bit+MKL was 0.307s
# 32-bit+ATLAS was 0.571s

# Testing /homes/eva/q/qpovey/sourceforge/kaldi/trunk/src/gmm/am-diag-gmm-test:
# 64-bit+ATLAS was 0.171s
# 32-bit+ATLAS was 0.205s
# 64-bit+MKL was 0.291s
