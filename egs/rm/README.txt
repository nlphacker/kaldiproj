  s1: This setup is experiments with GMM-based systems with various 
      Maximum Likelihood 
      techniques including global and speaker-specific transforms.
      See a parallel setup in ../wsj/s1
      
  s2: This setup is experiment with hybrid MLP system trained by
      stochastic gradient descent.
